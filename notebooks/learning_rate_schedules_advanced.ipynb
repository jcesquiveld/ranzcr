Although many practitioners are using simple learning rate schedules such as stepwise decay, research has shown that there are other strategies that work better in most situations. We implement a number of different schedule shapes in this tutorial and introduce cyclical schedules.\n\nSee the \"Learning Rate Schedules\" tutorial for a more basic overview of learning rates, and an example of how to use them while training your own models.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "%matplotlib inline\nimport copy\nimport math\nimport mxnet as mx\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "def plot_schedule(schedule_fn, iterations=1500):\n    # Iteration count starting at 1\n    iterations = [i+1 for i in range(iterations)]\n    lrs = [schedule_fn(i) for i in iterations]\n    plt.scatter(iterations, lrs)\n    plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Learning Rate\")\n    plt.show()", "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "outputs": [], "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Custom Schedule Shapes\n\n### (Slanted) Triangular\n\nWhile trying to push the boundaries of batch size for faster training, [Priya Goyal et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677) found that having a smooth linear warm up in the learning rate at the start of training improved the stability of the optimizer and lead to better solutions. It was found that a smooth increases gave improved performance over stepwise increases.\n\nWe look at \"warm-up\" in more detail later in the tutorial, but this could be viewed as a specific case of the **\"triangular\"** schedule that was proposed by [Leslie N. Smith (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186). Quite simply, the schedule linearly increases then decreases between a lower and upper bound.
