<h2>Description</h2>

This project is in a sense a follow-up of my previous project for the Cassava 
Leaf Disease classification Kaggle competition. There I reached the 394th position
on the private LB (just 4 places before the bronze medal threshold). That project
was a multiclass classification problem, while the present one is a multilabel
classification problem. Appart from that, I think both projects are similar and 
many common techniques (and tricks) may be used for both. In the previous project
I've created some source code which can be easily "transferred" to this one:
model, datasets, dataloaders, training scripts, ...

In this project I'm using the Pytorch Lightning library, which is very helpful
to keep your code clean and concentrate on the problem at hand and relieves you
of many code-related problems. I'm also using git and github seriously for the 
first time for my Python projects.

I hope with all this, this time I'll get my first Kaggle medal ;-)
